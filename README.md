**Supplier Performance and Profitability Analysis**
**Summary**

Supplier selection decisions influence profitability, working capital, service levels, and operational risk. However, organizations often evaluate vendors primarily on purchase price, overlooking their full financial and operational impact.

This project builds an integrated analytical framework to evaluate suppliers across the end-to-end procurement lifecycle. By combining sales, purchase, and inventory data, the analysis identifies which suppliers drive sustainable profit, which erode margins, and where procurement strategy can be optimized.

The results demonstrate how supplier performance analytics can support cost reduction, margin improvement, and more resilient supply chains.

**Problem Statement-**

Traditional supplier evaluation methods fail to capture the total economic impact of vendors. High-revenue suppliers may deliver low margins, while low-cost suppliers can increase holding costs, stock imbalances, or operational inefficiencies.

- This analysis addresses key strategic questions:

- Which suppliers generate the highest profit contribution?

- Do revenue leaders also deliver strong margins?

- Which vendors create disproportionate inventory or cost burdens?

**-How concentrated is supplier risk?**

Where should procurement focus renegotiation or diversification efforts?

**Analytical Framework**

An end-to-end pipeline was implemented to transform raw operational data into decision-ready insights.

**Data Integration**

Multiple datasets were consolidated to create a unified supplier performance view:

- Sales transactions

- Procurement records

- Inventory positions

- Supplier master data

**Processing and Analysis**

- Data cleaning and normalization

- Cross-dataset joins to link suppliers to financial outcomes

- Aggregation of supplier-level KPIs

- Margin and contribution analysis

- Inventory impact assessment

**Visualization**

Interactive dashboards were developed to enable stakeholder exploration of supplier performance metrics.

**Key Metrics Evaluated**

- Revenue contribution by supplier

- Profit and margin performance

- Purchase volume versus sales outcomes

- Inventory exposure linked to vendors

- Concentration of profit across supplier base

**Key Findings**

- Profit contribution is highly concentrated among a small subset of suppliers

- Several high-revenue vendors produce comparatively weak margins

- Certain suppliers are associated with disproportionate inventory levels, tying up working capital

- Supplier performance varies significantly across profitability, indicating opportunities for portfolio optimization

**Strategic Implications**

**The analysis highlights actionable opportunities for procurement and operations teams:**

- Prioritize high-margin suppliers for long-term partnerships

- Renegotiate terms with low-margin but high-volume vendors

- Diversify supplier base to reduce concentration risk

- Align procurement decisions with profitability rather than price alone

- Optimize inventory policies based on supplier characteristics
